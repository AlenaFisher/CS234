For this stage I worked on the files named: Inventory, Item, Sales, SalesManager, and SportsManagementSystem. Also, worked on updating the UML diagram.

Item gets information of an item like the id, name, and price which is used by the Inventory class.

Inventory allows for the addition or removal of items, as well as displaying all the items and searching for specific items.

The SalesManager maintains a collection of sales where each sale is associated with a unique ID. The value is than used by the Sales class. It also has methods to add a sale and find a sale by its ID.

The Sales class represents an individual sale. It has methods to get and set, add and remove items from the sale, and calculate a discount based on loyalty points.

The SportsManagementSystem holds the Sales management menu which then allows for the user to access the inventory or sales submenu.

The UML diagram is an updated version with all of the classes and the methods and variables that each of them use.
