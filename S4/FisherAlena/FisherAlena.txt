For this stage of the project, I worked on the program's main GUI, my personal main GUI, the appointment GUI, coaches GUI, equipment GUI, and the facility GUIs. These
GUIs allow the user to create, remove, update, and delete information for appointments, coaches, equipment, and games.
I also created the .jar file and worked on the UML diagram for my respective GUIs and class files.
